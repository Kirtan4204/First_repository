        <p>I aspire to be a Data Scientist one day. In today's technological world, the amount 
            of data collected is stupendous. This data is very beneficial to companies if it is
            analyzed properly. This work is done by a data scientist. A Data Scientist collects 
            this vast amount of data, and organizes it in a way that tells a company what to do 
            to grow their organization.</p> 

            <p>In the long run, my dream is to start my own company 
            which provides all kinds of software solutions to all kinds of businesses. 
            We would provide affordable software to small businesses such as a small restaurants 
            or grocery stores. Some of these small business don't know about the way technology 
            and software can help their business in a major way. They still record all 
            their data on paper mainly because they havent been introduced to basic software 
            like a database. My goal is to raise awareness about the immense benefits that 
            a good software program provides.</p>
